    SmartThings Build extends Samsung’s IoT platform to multi-family properties, enabling seamless integration of Samsung smart appliances into property management systems. Event-driven diagnostics, 
    automated work order creation, and a flexible API model support complex ownership and permissions, improving operational efficiency. Developers can leverage APIs, SDKs, and automation tools
    to streamline implementation and build rich user experiences. Future enhancements include expanded device support, enriched diagnostics, and deeper SmartThings app integration.
