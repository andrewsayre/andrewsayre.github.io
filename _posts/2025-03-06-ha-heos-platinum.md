I'm excited to share a personal milestone: the [Home Assistant HEOS integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/heos){:target="_blank"} has officially reached [platinum quality](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum){:target="_blank"}, released in version 2025.3! ðŸŽ‰

This designation isnâ€™t just a badgeâ€”it represents the highest standards of user experience and technical excellence in Home Assistant integrations. A huge thank you to Joost, Frenck, Josef, and many others who guided and reviewed my pull requests along the way.

### The Evolution of Home Assistantâ€™s Quality Scale

Home Assistant is constantly evolving, much like a living entity. The original quality scale, introduced over five years ago, had become outdated as the platform matured. Recognizing this, Joost led a community-driven effort to revamp the scale, aligning it with modern development practices and higher UX standards. The result? A newly updated quality scale, released at the end of last year.

### My Journey to Platinum

I first developed the HEOS integration in 2019, so when the new quality scale was introduced, I saw an opportunityâ€”not just to bring HEOS to platinum but to refresh my skills and reconnect with Home Assistantâ€™s latest best practices.

At first, the challenge seemed overwhelming. More than 50 requirements had to be met to reach the top tier, and many of them represented large rewrites. Some requirements were completely new to me, and in some cases, the best practices had flipped since I originally wrote the integration.

But as I dug in, I realized it wasn't as daunting as I feared. The documentation was incredibly helpful, and most of the changes just made sense. Looking at other platinum-level integrations gave me inspiration, and before long, I found the process not just doableâ€”but rewarding.

### Paying It Forward

This journey has been an amazing experience, and now I'm excited to help others advance their integrations along the quality scale. If you're working on the quality scale, don't hesitate to reach outâ€”I'd love to help or offer guidance!
