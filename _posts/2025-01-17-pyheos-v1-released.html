<p>I'm excited to announce that pyheos—an open-source Python library for controlling HEOS-capable products from Denon and Marantz—has reached 
    version 1.0.0! This major milestone fully implements the HEOS protocol specification.</p>

<p>This library powers over 580 projects, including the popular Home Assistant HEOS integration, in use by an estimated 10,000 users. 
    Known for its reliability, it simplifies controlling HEOS devices through automations and scenes, enhancing smart home experiences.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.0 brings improved reliability and lays the groundwork for exciting new features like browsing and playing media directly 
    through Home Assistant—similar to the HEOS app. Version 1.0.0 of pyheos will be included in the upcoming Home Assistant 2025.2.0 release.</p>

<p>I started pyheos over five years ago as a personal project to control my own devices and it has grown into something that helps thousands of people. 
    While I’m currently exploring new opportunities for my next full-time role, I’m proud to keep doing meaningful work that improves people’s lives.</p>
